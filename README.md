## 🎯 Key Interactions

- **Landing**: Cinematic title animation with "Enter the Universe" button
- **Navigation**: Floating glassmorphism nav with smooth section transitions
- **Projects**: 3D orbital camera controls, clickable project spheres
- **Skills**: Hover effects on skill cards with neural glow animations
- **Contact**: Interactive form with particle burst success animation

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Projects

Edit `data/projects.ts` to add new project realms:

```typescript
{
  id: 'new-project',
  title: 'Project Name',
  subtitle: 'The Realm Subtitle',
  description: 'Detailed description...',
  technologies: ['Tech1', 'Tech2'],
  position: [x, y, z], // 3D coordinates
  color: '#hexcolor',
  glowColor: '#hexcolor'
}
```

### Modifying Animations

Adjust animation timings in component files:
- Framer Motion variants for UI animations
- Three.js useFrame hooks for 3D animations
- CSS keyframes in globals.css for background effects

### Styling Customization

The design system uses custom CSS variables and Tailwind utilities:
- Neural colors: `neural-blue`, `neural-purple`, `neural-teal`
- Glass effects: `glass`, `glass-strong`
- Glow effects: `neural-glow`

## 🚀 Deployment

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

Deploy to Vercel for optimal performance with edge functions and automatic optimizations.

## 📱 Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

WebGL support required for 3D features.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This portfolio embodies the concept of "intelligence in motion" - where every interaction, animation, and visual element reflects the intersection of human creativity and machine capability. The 3D universe serves as a metaphor for the interconnected nature of modern software systems.
